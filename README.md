# usual_ML_algorithm  
## Some usually used machine learning algorithms implemented by matlab  
## Part1:  
### Gaussian_discriminant  
### Naive Bayesian  
Implement **naive bayesian** and a spam email classifier using naive bayesian.
## Part2:  
### Some Linear Models  
Implement some linear models, including **Linear regression**, **logistic regression**, **perceptron**, **SVM** and their testing. Also, a **regularization** version of these linear models. I choose the lambda in regularization using **corss-validation**.  
## Part3:  
### Neural Network
Implement a one hidden layer **neural network** and its feedforward and backpropagation process and a **weight decay** and **momentum** version of it.
### KNN  
Implement **KNN** and use KNN to recognize CAPTCHA of my school website.  
### K-means  
Implement **K-means** and use K-means in picture compression 
## Part4:  
### Spectral Clustering
Implement **spectral clustering** and use it in news clustering.
### PCA
Implement **PCA** and use it to rotate a roteted CAPTCHA picture to horizontal direction.  
Use **PCA** and **KNN** to recognize faces.
