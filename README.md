# usual_ML_algorithm  
Some usually used machine learning algorithms implemented by matlab  
Part1:  
gaussian_discriminant  
a spam email classifier using naive bayesian  
Part2:  
Some linear models, including Linear regression, logistic regression, perceptron, SVM and their testing. Also, a regularization version of these linear models. I choose the lambda in regularization using corss-validation.
Part3:  
One hidden layer neural network and its feedforward and backpropagation process and a weight decay and momentum version of it.
KNN and use it to recognize CAPTCHA of my school website.  
K-means and use it in picture compression
